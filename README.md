pinHP Arcade image for Pi2Jamma/Pi2SCART

pinHP image aims to be an as simple as possible replacement for those dreadful multi-game (e. g. 60-in-1) Arcade PCBs in classic Jamma Arcade cabinets (or SCART TV sets) with 15 kHz tube monitors. There is just one emulator (Advance Mame) for some 4,000 Arcade games (6,000 including clones and bootlegs) available with the 0.106 ROM set. No other emulations, no SNES, no Amiga, no choice. Start it up and a kindergarten child will find its way to run a game, without being able to change settings by mistake. Just explain the button combinations to ‚insert‘ a coin and to exit, and they‘re good to go.
